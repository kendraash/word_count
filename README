#### This program will count the number of times a word appears in a give sentence

### By Kendra Ash

##
  This program uses a method of type Spring. It takes a sentence and a word which is provided by the user.
  It then takes the string entered and divides the sentence from the word into an array by splitting when
  it comes to a "., ? or !". It then defines word and sentence and splits them up into individual arrays.
  It then loops through the sentence and
  checks using a comparison operator if the word is the same as the current word in the sentence.
  The loop runs the length of the sentence. If the word is in the sentence there is a variable called word_count which
  keeps the running total of the number of times word appears in the sentence.


  ## Setup

  * Separate input into array
  * Set sentence equal to first part of input
  * Set word equal to the second part of input
  * Set search sentence and count number of times word appears

## Technologies Used
